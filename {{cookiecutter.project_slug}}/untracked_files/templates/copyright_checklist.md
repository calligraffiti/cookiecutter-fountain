# Screenplay Copyright Checklist

Many screenwriters protect themselves by going through the [WGA script registration service](https://www.wgawregistry.org/), but remember, submitting to the WGA Registry is not the same thing as copyrighting your screenplay. Registration, only establishes a *Tangible Medium* date of completion.

To sell your screenplay, it is essential to establish a *Chain of Title*, or the ownership or rights of a written work. The best way to accomplish this is to copyright your screenplay through the *Library of Congress' E-Copyright Office.*

1. Login to [Library of Congress E-Copyright Office](https://eco.copyright.gov/)
2. Once logged in click on the "Register a Work" tab.
3. You must register as a *'work of Performing Arts'* and ***not*** as a 'motion picture.' That is reserved for filmed, finished motion pictures.
4. Information Required. Make sure you have the following info ready
		a). Title of Work (on form, select *'Title of work being registered'*)
		b). Year of Completion *(Also year of publication, nation of first published, and ISN (optional), if work is published)*
		c). Name(s) of Author(s)
		d). Publication/Completion (Form: *'Has this work been published?'*)
			(ℹ) Normally you will select 'No'. Selecting 'Yes' implies that your script is 'published', e.g. if you have offered copies of it for sale or rent.
		e). Other sections include *Authors*, *Claimants* (other parties who claim ownership), *Limitation of claim* (for re-registration of previously registered material), *Rights & Permissions* (Public record! Any information entered here will appear in the offices online catalog. Do not complete this part if you do not want this contact info included in the offices online record.)
		f). Carefully review submission. If you need to make corrections use the links in the navigation bar to make corrections
		g). A copy of the manuscript for upload (for a screenplay, this should be one *complete* copy of the digital file. *Be sure to check file before upload.*)
			*(Do not upload a .FOUNTAIN file. We recommend your rendered .PDF, or .TXT file in Fountain format)*
			The following formats are accepted:
				- .doc (Microsoft Word Document)
				- .docx (Microsoft Word Open XML Document)
				- .html (HyperText Markup Language)
				- .pdf (Portable Document Format) ***Recommended***
				- .rtf (Rich Text Document)
				- .txt (Text File)
1. After review click *'Add to Cart'*, and pay Fee. As of this writing, the filing fee is $35 for *Single Application*†, and $55 for *Standard Application*‡. You should receive an email confirmation of your payment.
		(ℹ) The copyright claim is established the moment your payment is received, but your *copyright certificate* can take up to **16 months** to receive.
1. After submitting payment you must upload a copy of the work being registered. You should receive an email confirming the successful upload of your submission.
		(ℹ) You may submit a digital file at this time or opt to send by mail, which may incur additional fees.


(ℹ) Copyright.gov offer video previews of the submission process:
	- [Single Application](https://stream-media.loc.gov/copyright/single.mp4)† -- One work by one author.
	- [Standard Application](https://stream-media.loc.gov/copyright/standard.mp4)‡ -- This application can be used for single author too, but is especially for works created, or owned, by two or more people.

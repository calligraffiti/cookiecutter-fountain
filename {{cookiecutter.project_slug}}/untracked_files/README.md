# About This Directory

This directory is ignored by Git. Use this directory for any files you *do not* want tracked in your Git repository. There are some basic template files in this directory you may copy into the main directory. Just copy them over to your project directory, the one your `.fountain` file lives, and rename to it to the Character, or Scene you wish to work up.

If you change your mind, and would like this directory added to your repo, simply remove `/untracked_files/` from the .gitignore file in your repository. *Note* that you may not be able to see your .ignore file if you do not have *Show hidden files* enabled. It will however be available to view and edit directly on your remote repository if you have set one up.
